# 📄 GenAI-Based Applicant Tracking System (ATS)

## 📌 Overview

An **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** is used by organizations to automatically analyze resumes and match them with job descriptions.
This project implements a **mini ATS platform** using **Flask, PDF parsing, and Google Gemini GenAI** to simulate real-world resume screening used in recruitment systems.

The system accepts a **resume in PDF format** and a **job description**, analyzes both, and generates an **AI-based evaluation** including match percentage and feedback.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Manual resume screening is:

* Time-consuming
* Error-prone
* Not scalable

This project aims to **automate resume evaluation** using a GenAI-powered backend workflow.

---

## ⚙️ System Flow

1. User uploads a **resume PDF**
2. Backend extracts text from the PDF
3. Resume content is parsed using Gemini GenAI
4. Job description is parsed using Gemini GenAI
5. ATS logic compares resume and job description
6. AI-generated analysis is returned as JSON

---

## 🛠 Technology Stack

* **Python**
* **Flask**
* **HTML / CSS** (Frontend)
* **PyPDF2** (PDF text extraction)
* **Google Gemini GenAI**
* **JSON**

## 📥 API Design

### Endpoint

```
POST /analyze
```

### Input

* Resume PDF (`multipart/form-data`)
* Job description (text)

### Output (JSON)

* Parsed resume data
* Parsed job description
* ATS evaluation result

---

## 🧠 ATS Evaluation Includes

* Match Percentage (0–100)
* Matching skills
* Missing skills
* Strengths
* Improvement suggestions

---

## 📌 Sample Input

* **Resume**: `resume.pdf`
* **Job Description**:
  Backend Developer with experience in Python, APIs, and database systems.

---

## 📊 Sample Output

```json
{
  "parsed_resume": "...",
  "parsed_job_description": "...",
  "ats_result": "Match Percentage: 80% ..."
}
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install flask PyPDF2 werkzeug google-genai
```

### 2️⃣ Set Gemini API Key (Environment Variable)

```bash
setx GOOGLE_API_KEY "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Restart VS Code after setting the key.

---

### 3️⃣ Run the Flask App

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

---

### 4️⃣ Access the Application

* Open browser
* Upload resume PDF
* Paste job description
* Click **Analyze Resume**

---

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, students learn to:

* Build a Flask-based backend application
* Handle file uploads securely
* Extract text from PDFs
* Design GenAI prompts
* Implement an ATS-style evaluation system
* Understand real-world GenAI use cases in HR tech

---

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

* Strict JSON output formatting
* Resume and JD embeddings for semantic matching
* Frontend result visualization
* Database integration
* RAG-based ATS system

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **PDF parsing, backend APIs, and Generative AI** can be combined to build a **real-world ATS system**.
It provides practical exposure to how AI is applied in recruitment and enterprise systems.
